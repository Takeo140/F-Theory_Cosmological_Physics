## Scientific Foundation: F-Theory
This framework is rooted in **F-Theory Cosmological Physics**, which unifies:
* [cite_start]**Obverse (Material Aspect):** Observable matter, energy, and spacetime[cite: 5, 13, 15].
* [cite_start]**Reverse (Mathematical Aspect):** Logical structure and physical laws[cite: 5, 17, 18].

[cite_start]By applying the **Extremal Principle ($\delta\mathcal{A}[\Psi]=0$)**, we derive cosmic expansion, dark matter, and gravitational field equations as logical necessities[cite: 11, 14, 24, 28, 31].
